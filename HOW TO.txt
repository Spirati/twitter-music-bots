You're going to do this one album at a time.
Start by putting all the music files into a folder called "input" in the same folder as this .exe, along with an image called "cover.png" or "cover.jpg" (as appropriate)
Then run the .exe -- it'll do a long bit of processing, then eventually open a link to Twitter: here sign in with the account that's going to HOST THE MUSIC, not the account that's going to act as the bot
Give it some time to cook, and it'll eventually spit out a CBDQ source
Log in to CBDQ with the BOT ACCOUNT and paste in the source, set it to post every hour, hit save, you're golden
